# TextEditor

This is a simple Text Editor built using Java Swing. I made it as a basic GUI application that lets users open and save `.txt` files. It has a clean interface with just two buttons: Open and Save, and a large text area where users can edit their text. When you click "Open", you can browse and load a text file into the editor, and the "Save" button lets you write your changes back to a file. I used `JFileChooser` for file handling and `JTextArea` for the main text input area. This project helped me understand more about Java Swing components and file I/O operations in Java. It's pretty lightweight and useful for small editing tasks.
